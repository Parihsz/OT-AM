Basically the door opens when you get close to it and opens when u get far from it, it works by opening the door (when it's not opening already) on the onEnter event and closing on the onLeave event (only if no players are in that Area).

## Clientside example: Gui popup

A Gui becomes visible when you enter an area and when u leave the area it will become invisible.
