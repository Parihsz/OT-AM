## Serverside example: Automatic proximity sensor door

Basically the door opens when you get close to it and opens when u get far from it, it works by opening the door(if it is closed) onEnter event and closing on onLeave event (only if no players are in that Area).

A Gui becomes visible when you enter and an area and invisible when u leave the area.
