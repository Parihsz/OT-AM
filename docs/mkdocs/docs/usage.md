# Usage

After aquiring the module ([see README](https://github.com/VerdommeMan/OT-AM))

You can do this completely another way. But this is how i would do it:

## SERVER ONLY
Module in SS and require from scripts in SSS

## CLIENT ONLY
Module in RS + require from LS in playerscripts

## CLIENT & SERVER
Module in RS + require from playerscripts and SSS
