# When should OT&AM be used?

## Good use cases:
- If you want to know when an object enters/leaves an Area
- If you want to know in which area the object is
- If you want to know which objects are inside an area

## Bad use cases:
- Getting the parts in an Area, there are other modules meant for this
- Areas that arent stationary
