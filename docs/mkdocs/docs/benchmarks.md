# Benchmarks
Here i compare the benchmarks between OT&AM, Zone+ and Region3. And each benchmark will have its rbxl file stored in the folder [benchmarks](https://github.com/VerdommeMan/OT-AM/tree/master/Benchmarks). So that you can easily see the difference for yourself.

!!! note "If you run these benchmarks you will have different results but you should see a similar trend"

??? note "I didnt include RAM in these benchmarks"
    There were big jumps in the RAM usages, even when there are no scripts running, any measurement would give a bad impression.
    If you do want to see the RAM usages, i suggest that you download one of the benchmarks.

!!! note "I used AV7 with OT&AM while AV2 is considerable faster"

??? info "general info about benchmarks"
    - all benchmarks are done with localserver + 1 player
    - all benchmarks are done on the server
    - with coreloop i mean, one loop over areas and see if it found something

## Benchmarks OT&AM/Zone+/Region3

### Benchmark of small area/parts

??? info "STATS"
    - Areas: 5
    - Area size AVG: 50, 50, 50
    - AVG parts per Area: 287
    - Heartbeat: 60
    - The amount of iterations for AVG coreloop: 500 
    - Filename: 

=== "OT&AM"
    - how long one coreloop took: 1.7629400826991e-05 s

    specs


### Benchmark of medium area and medium amount of parts

### Benchmark of huge area and huge amount of parts

!!! help "If you have any better way to measure/compare between these methods please let me know"

## Benchmark of PiP of AV2 vs AV7 vs RR3

## Benchmark of PiP AV2/AV7 method vs Region3 method
