This class replaces Region3 and adds method for checking if a Position is inside the Area.
So that means the Area can only be Axis aligned/rotated or it will have unexpected results

API:

Constructors:
    AreaV2.new(Vector3 minVector, Vector3 maxVector)
        > returns an Area
    AreaV2.new(CFrame cframe, Vector3 Size)
        > turns a cframe and size into minVector and maxVector
        > returns an Area
    AreaV2.new(BasePart part)
        > gets the Size and CFrame from this part
        > turns a cframe and size into minVector and maxVector
        > returns an Area

Methods:
    AreaV2:isInArea(Vector3 position)
        > returns a boolean, true if the position is inside the area
    AreaV2:getCF_Size()
        > returns the CFrame and Size of said Area

Properties:
    AreaV2.minV
        > returns Vector3 that is bottom corner of that Area
    AreaV2.maxV
        >  returns Vector3 that is a top corner diagonally from AreaV2.min of that Area
